Welcome to the Codewars Bar!
Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.

Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.

Example parties:
Input 0:
"1 beer"

Output 0:
"1 glass of water"

Explaination 0:
You drank one standard drink

Input 1:
"1 shot, 5 beers, 2 shots, 1 glass of wine, 1 beer"

Output 1:
"10 glasses of water"

Explaination 1:
You drank ten standard drinks

Note:

To keep the things simple, we'll considere that any "numbered thing" in the string is a drink. Even "1 bear" => "1 glass of water" or "1 chainsaw and 2 pools" => "3 glasses of water"...

        var x = aux.Split(' ').Select(int.Parse).Sum();
        return (x == 1) ? "1 glass of water" : $"{x} glasses of water";
